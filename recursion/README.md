In this repo are some code snippets while I am trying to learn Gleam / Functional Programming Languages and improve at recursions

# recursion
[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/recursion)](https://hex.pm/packages/recursion)
[![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/recursion/)

```sh
gleam add recursion@1
```
```gleam
import recursion

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/recursion>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
